        <maintenance>Schedules: Weekly, monthly, 3 month, 1 &amp; 3 year
Procedures: 
Weekly
Clean space/signs of rodents
Fuel system
Main supply tank level
Day tank level
Day tank float switch
Test supply or transfer pump operation
Test solenoid valve operation
Flexible hose and connectors
Air filter
Lubrication system
------------------
Oil level (add if necessary per manufacturer's specifications)
Oil or block heater
Cooling system
--------------
Level
Adequate cooling water to heat exchanger per manufacturer's specifications
Adequate fresh air through radiator 
Water pump(s)
Condition of flexible hoses and connection
Jacket water heater
Battery system (NFPA 110 2010 edition)
--------------
Check battery connections for cleanliness and tightness and record condition in log.
Check electrolyte level in batteries (refill to proper level with distilled water if needed) per manufacturer's specifications.
Check battery charger for proper operation. 
Check charger amperage 
Electrical system
-----------------
General inspection
General condition of EPSS-any unusual condition of vibration, noise, temperature, or deterioration
Control switch in auto position
Visual inspect each Automatic transfer switch
Disconnect switches
Overcurrent protective devices (fuses, circuit breakers)


Monthly
Record the following in the generator test log:
Hour reading: start and stop and total run time
Oil level - radiator coolant level - day tank level
Which ATS initiated during load test
Batteries (avg.): water level and specific gravity
Time of test: start and stop. Time to start/transfer
Did all ATS`s transfer? Explain if not.
Oil pressure - engine water temp - evidence of wet stacking
Voltage: Phase I, Phase II, Phase III
Frequency/cycles - hospital load test kw
Fuel tank level - oil switch returned to normal
**If load is not at least 30% of nameplate notify mgr to do load bank test

Write PM work order number on any vendor paperwork and scan


Also verify services performed by outside contractor
Visual inspection
Check oil level
Check for leaks
Check / adjust belts
Check indicator lights
Check coolant level
Check hydrometer readings
Check battery chargers
Check exhaust stack
General cleaning
Perform conductance test for sealed batteries

The monthly tests for diesel-powered emergency generators are conducted with a dynamic load that is at least 30% of the nameplate rating of the generator or meets the manufacturer's recommended prime movers exhaust gas temperature. If the hospital does not meet either the 30% of nameplate rating or the recommended exhaust gas temperature during any test in EC.02.05.07, EP 5, then it must test the emergency generator once every 12 months using supplemental (dynamic or static) loads of 50% of nameplate rating for 30 minutes, followed by 75% of nameplate rating for 60 minutes, for a total of 1 continuous hours. Note: Tests for non-diesel-powered generators need only be conducted with available load.

3 month
See attached doc

1 year
Change oil
Check fresh air intake
Check filters and breathers 
Change fuel filters and clean crankcase breathers
Check and if necessary clean external core of radiator
 
Have qualified outside contractor perform load bank test
Per JCAHO... Facilities not able to meet the 30% rule must  have (2) hour load bank test performed by qualified outside contractor every year. 
Per utility meeting 4/5/01 Encinitas, Chula Vista, Green does meet 30% rule - therefore no load bank test required...
Write PM work order number on any vendor paperwork and scan


3 year
Test generator at least once every 36 months for a minimum of four continuous hours.  This test shall be conducted under a load (dynamic or static) that is at least 30% of the nameplate rating of the generator
EC 2.5.7.4 - 7/22/15
At least once every 36 months, hospitals with a generator providing emergency power for the services listed in EC.02.05.03, EPs 5 and 6, test each emergency generator for a minimum of 4 continuous hours. The test results and completion dates are documented. Note: For additional guidance, see NFPA 110-2010, Chapter 8

The 36-month diesel-powered emergency generator test uses a dynamic or static load that is at least 30% of the nameplate rating of the generator or meets the manufacturer's recommended prime movers` exhaust gas temperature. Note: Tests for non-diesel-powered generators need only be conducted with available load
