Procedures:
3 month
Verify the following checks have been performed by the outside contractor:
Check refrigerant charge
Check oil level and condition of oil
Check efficiency output of compressor
Check operation of unloaders and check pump down cycle
Check motors: lubricate bearings as needed; check leads for tightness;
Check sheaves and/or couplings for alignment and securing to shafts;
Check and record motor voltage and amperage
Check fans: lubricate and check alignment of bearings for wear or any unusual noise; check belt tension and wear; check all sheaves and wheels for alignment and tightness
Check starter and switches: thoroughly clean out all dust and dirt from inside of cabinet; check for loose screws and springs; check all release mechanisms for proper operation.
Check unit for proper water flow (if applicable
Instruct operator (if applicable)
Report all detected deficiences to owner

Effective 1/1/2011 per Calif Air Resources Board (CARB), Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation, Part 82:
All facilities with stationary non-residential refrigeration systems w/more than 50 lbs of refrigerant are required to perform leak detection inspections, leak repairs and recordkeeping. (Systems using ammonia or carbon dioxide are excluded from this requirement.)
Have U.S. Env. Protection Agency-certified technician perform leak detection, including repairing leaks prior to recharging and properly evacuating cylinders before disposal. 
Document all work performed in service history.
